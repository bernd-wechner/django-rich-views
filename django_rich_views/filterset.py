Filterset extensions

django-url-filter is a great package that parses GET parameters into Django filter arguments.

    http://django-url-filter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Alas it does not have a nice way to pretty print the filter for reporting it on views,
nor for extracting the filter options cleanly for reconstructing a URL or QuerySet.

    There's a sad, known round trip problem with date_times in Python 3.6 and earlier.
    The str() value fo a datetime for timezone aware date_times produces a timezone
    format of Â±[hh]:[mm] but the django DateTimeField when it validates inputs does not
    recognize this format (because it uses datetime.strptime() and this is a known round
    trip bug discussed for years here:

    fix() is like str() except for datetime objects only it removes that offending colon
    so the datetime can be parsed with a strptime format of '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S%z' (which
    must be added to Django's DATETIME_INPUT_FORMATS of it's going to support round
    tripping on DateTimeFields.

    Returns a ModelFilterSet (from url_filter) that is built from
    the GET params and the session stored filter(s).

    In the session supports "filter" and "filter_priorities". The latter
    is just a dict supplying a of field names to try "filter" if "filter"
    is not a field on the model. This means for example you specify a generic
    name for a filter that is implemented on different models in different
    fields. The fields can be related too (so in a related model).

    Each entry in priorities is test in order to see if is_filter_field is
    True, and if so that is the field used. is_filter_field suppports
    related model fields (components seprated with "__")

    the model and request are taken from the view, unless overrriden, a
    mechanism making these tailored filtersets available more gnerally from
    places without a view object.
